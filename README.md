# Welcome to NULL SKY, adventurer!
This is my most recent attempt at creating a usable client for the [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io/) MMO RPG. My goal with this project is simply to have a good time learning a new language and DB utility that I have zero prior experience with.

If you stumbled across this project looking for some good advice on how to write in Golang or to steal my trade secrets in-game you've come to the wrong place friend! I'm doing this mostly for the data collection and TUI building experience, I'd be lucky if my agent completes even a single contract per bi-weekly reset!

# What this project is:
- A dual purpose Linux server performance monitor + a Spacetraders API game client
- An outlet to learn everything I can about Golang, SQLite, PHP, & Apache

# What this project is NOT:
- Intended for actual distribution...This is just a fun project for me to learn and grow.
- A point of reference for how programming should be done. While I've been writing PHP and building tools for several years I'm still VERY new to these topics.
